# Particle Explosion Animation
This is the first bigger C++ project that I have made. Doing this project I have learnt:

 - Object oriented design
 - Creating program window
 - Using buffer, textures and renderers
 - Changing particle's color by bit operations
 - And more!

I have been doing this project following tutorial @Cave of Programming on YouTube.
